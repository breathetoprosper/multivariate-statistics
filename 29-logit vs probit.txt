Logits and probits are both types of link functions used in logistic regression and probit regression, 
respectively, to model the relationship between predictor variables and a binary outcome variable. 
Here's a concise explanation of the difference between them:
Logits

    Used in: Logistic Regression
    Definition: The logit function is the natural logarithm of the odds of the probability of the event occurring. 
    It transforms the probability pp into a log-odds scale.
    Formula: logit(p)=log⁡(p/(1-p))
    Interpretation: A logit model estimates the probability of the event occurring by modeling the log-odds of the probability as a linear combination of predictor variables.
    Function in Logistic Regression: The output of the logistic regression model is passed through the sigmoid function to obtain a probability.

Probits

    Used in: Probit Regression
    Definition: The probit function is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. It transforms the probability pp into a z-score in the normal distribution.
    Formula: probit(p)=Φ^−1(p), where Φ^-1 is the inverse of the CDF of the standard normal distribution.
    Interpretation: A probit model estimates the probability of the event occurring by modeling the z-score 
    (which corresponds to the cumulative probability) as a linear combination of predictor variables.
    Function in Probit Regression: The output of the probit regression model is interpreted as the standard normal deviate, 
    which is then used to estimate probabilities.

Key Differences

    Transformation Function:
        Logit: Uses the logistic function to map the real line into the (0, 1) interval.
        Probit: Uses the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution to map the real line into the (0, 1) 
        interval.

    Assumptions:
        Logit: Assumes that the error term follows a logistic distribution.
        Probit: Assumes that the error term follows a normal distribution.

    Interpretation of Coefficients:
        Logit: Coefficients represent the change in the log-odds of the dependent variable per unit change in the predictor.
        Probit: Coefficients represent the change in the z-score of the normal distribution per unit change in the predictor.

Summary

    Logit function is used in logistic regression, where the relationship between the predictors and 
    the probability of the outcome is modeled using log-odds.
    Probit function is used in probit regression, where the relationship between the predictors and 
    the probability of the outcome is modeled using the z-scores from the normal distribution.

Both models are used for binary classification but differ in the distributional assumptions about the error terms.
