we do anova to determine  if 
there are any statistically significant differences between the means 
of three or more independent (unrelated) groups.
More precisely,  if:
Result: Significant (p < 0.05),means at least one group differs from the others.

However, it does not tell us which specific groups 
differ from each otherâ€”only that there is some difference somewhere among the groups.

Post-hoc tests are performed after finding a significant result from ANOVA.
They help to determine exactly which pairs of groups differ from each other.
The test is Tukey's HSD.

We Control for Type I Errors: 
Post-hoc tests adjust for the increased risk of Type I errors (false positives) 
that occur when multiple comparisons are made.

In summary, ANOVA tells you whether there's a significant effect overall, 
while post-hoc tests help you pinpoint where the differences are between specific groups.

-----------------------------------------------------

Group 1 Group 2 - p-value> 0.05, so we don't reject the null. 
meaning: there is no significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2.
The other combos we reject:
Group 1 is significantly different from Group 3.
Group 2 is significantly different from Group 3.

now we know which grops are significantly different.
